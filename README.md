## About Me

Detail-oriented Data Scientist with 1.5 years of software development experience and a strong foundation in Python. Experienced in data collection, cleaning, preprocessing, and performing **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** using tools like Pandas and Matplotlib. Skilled in building **predictive models** and **developing dashboards** to drive business insights, as demonstrated in projects like **Smartmart retail analysis** and **OCD patient data research**. Proficient in machine learning techniques to uncover patterns, optimize decision-making, and provide data-driven solutions in both retail and healthcare domains.
## Projects

Here are some of the projects that I have worked on:
### Project 1:**[Supermart Sales Analysis and Prediction]**(https://github.com/ANUSHA-E-M/Supermart-Sales-Analysis-and-Prediction)    

**Status:** In Progress (Expected Completion: 1/2025)  

**Description:**  
This project utilizes a dataset containing grocery sales information from a supermart to explore retail trends, engineer meaningful features, and build a machine learning model to predict sales and profitability. The insights aim to enhance decision-making for inventory management and consumer behavior analysis.

**Key Features:**  
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**  
  - Ensured high-quality retail data by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.  
- **Feature Engineering:**  
  - Applied advanced data manipulation techniques to transform raw data into actionable insights.  
- **Predictive Modeling:**  
  - Developed machine learning models to predict sales and profitability trends, enabling better business performance tracking and inventory optimization.  

**Technologies Used:**  
- **Python:** Data processing and analysis (libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **Scikit-learn:** Machine learning model development and evaluation  
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Interactive data exploration and visualization  

**Objectives:**  
- Analyze consumer behavior to identify purchasing patterns.  
- Optimize inventory management strategies through predictive analytics.  
- Enhance sales forecasting accuracy and profitability analysis.  

### Project 2: **[OCD Patient Trends Analysis]**(https://github.com/ANUSHA-E-M/OCD-Patient-Analysis)   
**Description:**  
Analyzed a dataset of 1,500 OCD patients to uncover significant demographic, clinical, and treatment trends. This project aimed to provide insights into OCD treatment personalization and refine clinical protocols based on key findings.

**Key Features:**  
- **Prevalence Insights:**  
  - Analyzed variability in Y-BOCS scores: obsessions (mean: 20.1) and compulsions (mean: 19.6), underscoring the need for personalized treatment strategies.  
- **Symptom Correlations:**  
  - Identified negative correlations between compulsion and obsession types (-0.23 to -0.27), highlighting distinct symptom presentations.  
- **Medication Impact:**  
  - Discovered a strong negative correlation between benzodiazepines and SSRIs/SNRIs, providing guidance for optimized prescribing practices.  
- **Demographic Trends:**  
  - Noted age and gender differences, particularly higher obsession severity in older women.  
- **Comorbidity Insights:**  
  - Found negative correlations among diagnoses (e.g., GAD, MDD, PTSD), helping refine diagnostic protocols.  
- **Family History:**  
  - Revealed trends suggesting genetic and environmental factors in OCD severity, enhancing clinical assessment frameworks.

**Key Data Points Explored:**  
- Y-BOCS Scores (obsessions and compulsions)  
- Symptom duration  
- Comorbid conditions  
- Medication use  

**Technologies Used:**  
- **Python:** Data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization (libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **Scikit-learn:** For correlation analysis and initial trend identification  
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive data exploration  

**Highlights:**  
- Provided actionable insights for personalized OCD treatments and clinical decision-making.  
- Identified crucial demographic and clinical variables influencing OCD symptomology.
